Most of the Windows end-users do not have Python installed on their OS,
so we strongly suggest you download and use a ready-to-use OctaDist executable.

Running OctaDist can be completed in a few steps as follows:

1. Download program executable (\*.exe) to your machine::

    OctaDist-*-Win-x86-64.exe

2. Right click on program icon and select::

    Run as administrator

3. Click::

    Yes

FYI: For first time using OctaDist, you should run it as an administrator with full rights.
