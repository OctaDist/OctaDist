Most of the Windows end-users do not have Python installed on their OS,
so we strongly suggest you download and use a ready-to-use OctaDist executable.

Running OctaDist can be completed in a few steps as follows:

1. Download program executable (\*.exe) to your machine::

    OctaDist-*-Win-x86-64.exe

2. Right click on program icon and select::

    Run as administrator

3. Click::

    Yes


.. note::

    Windows Defender might recognize OctaDist as third-party software.
    For first time starting OctaDist in Windows, you should run it as 
    an administrator with full rights.
