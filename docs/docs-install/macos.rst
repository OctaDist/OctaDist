Like Linux, installing OctaDist on macOS can be completed in a few steps as follows:

1. Press **Command** - **spacebar** to launch Spotlight and type ``Terminal``,
   then double-click the search result.

2. Use ``pip`` command to install OctaDist::
   
    pip install --user octadist
   
3. Execute OctaDist GUI, just type::
  
    octadist

   or::

    octadist_gui
  
4. If you want to execute OctaDist with command-line, just type::

    octadist_cli

In case you are not able to install the latest version of OctaDust, you can try the older stable version:

::

    pip install --user octadist==2.6.1
