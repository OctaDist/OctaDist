=============

**OctaDist: A tool for computing the distortion parameters in coordination complexes.**


OctaDist (**Octa**\hedral **Dist**\ortion calculator) is an inorganic chemistry and crystallography program 
for computing the distortion parameters, such as distance and angle distortions, in coordination complexes. 
For example, they are used for tracking structural change of the spin-crossover complex when the electronics 
spin-state changes from low-spin to high-spin, and vice versa. OctaDist can also be used to study other kind of 
the metal complex such as perovskite and metal-organic framework (MOF).
