Why OctaDist?
-------------
Octahedral complex can be simply classified into two types: regular and distorted octahedron. 
The complexes with regular octahedral geometry (perfect octahedron) are expected to form, 
when all of the ligands are of the same kind. In contrast, if the ligands are of different kinds, 
the complex would turns the distorted octahedron instead. Octahedral distortion parameters 
has been widely used for determining the change of the distortion of the complexes.

Even though the people in community generally calculate the octahedral distortion parameters 
for their complexes, but they not used a certain way to do this. Moreover, there is no software 
for determining this kind of parameter yet. Therefore, we present the OctaDist program as 
a choice for those who are interested in this.
